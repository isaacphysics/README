# Isaac Physics & Isaac Computer Science

The [@isaacphysics](https://github.com/isaacphysics) GitHub organisation contains the source code for the Isaac platform that underlies [Isaac Physics](https://isaacphysics.org) and [Isaac Computer Science](https://isaaccomputerscience.org). We occasionally post updates to our technical blog, [labs.isaacphysics.org](https://labs.isaacphysics.org).

Git repositories with names starting `isaac-...` may not be of immediate use to others interested in online education, although they may provide useful reference. The two main exceptions are [`isaac-react-app`](https://github.com/isaacphysics/isaac-react-app), the web-app frontend of the core Isaac platform; and [`isaac-api`](https://github.com/isaacphysics/isaac-api), the server side of the core Isaac platform.

Projects that may prove more widely useful include:
 - [`equality-checker`](https://github.com/isaacphysics/equality-checker): a microservice for checking the equivalence of algebraic expressions;
 - [`inequality`](https://github.com/isaacphysics/inequality): an equation editor for the web, and itself an update on [`equality`](https://github.com/isaacphysics/equality);
 - [`inequality-grammar`](https://github.com/isaacphysics/inequality-grammar): a parser for basic mathematics in text form which integrates with Inequality;
 - [`chemistry-checker`](https://github.com/isaacphysics/chemistry-checker): a Java server for checking the equivalence of chemical expressions.

If you have any questions about the project or code, please [get in touch with us](https://isaacphysics.org/contact).

Happy problem solving!
